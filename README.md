# Telegram Bot Java Library
A simple to use library to create Telegram Bots in Java (Still Beta Version)

## Webhooks vs GetUpdates
Both ways are supported (but I still didn't tested webhooks). To change between them, just go to *BuildVars.java* and change variable *useWebHook* value.

## Example bots
Open them and send them */help* command to get some information about their capabilities:
